# SnapShop

The server and database were built by my instructors at Galvanize and my task was to build the front end using Angular JS 1.5.8 and ES6 syntax. Prior to this project, I had no experience with Angular and I was amazed that I could get a functional e-commerce site up and running within two weeks. I was really pleased with how much Angular provides out of the box, especially how easy it was to create the search functionality.
